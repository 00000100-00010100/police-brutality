### Police arrest man, apparently for speaking | Jun 1st

A line of police stand well apart from a crowd of protestors, one of whom is speaking about the police's use of excessive force. Several officers move in to arrest the speaking man, pepper spraying him and others at point-blank range in order to do so. The arrested man is dragged/pushed/falls face down onto the road.
